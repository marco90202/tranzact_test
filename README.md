## Project Explanation
Project's scope was done for the main functionalities which are list, add and remove bets into a drawer where the user can review the bets done, further validations such as disable button after placing a bet, changing the color of the button to know which bets have been done or fully functioning testing where not achieve due time constraints.

As it was a small SPA app I decided to not use `Redux` as props were not going to be passed across many components.

The same can be tell about `Typescript`.
